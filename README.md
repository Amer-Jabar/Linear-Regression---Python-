# Linear-Regression---Python-

### This project is the simple linear regression algorithm made in python from scratch. 
#### It depends on libraries like matplotlib and numpy. There are comments with each step to demonstrate the mathematis behind the algorithm. The plotting scripts show the optimization steps and how Gradient Descent reduces the loss function.

#### The following picture shows training the model on data and the progression of GD algorithm - newton method:
